# IDENTIFYING-APPLICATION-LAYER-DDoS-ATTACKS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Developed a machine learning-based system to detect application-layer DDoS attacks that mimic legitimate traffic. Trained and evaluated models like Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree using NSL-KDD and N-BaIoT datasets, achieving over 99% accuracy through effective feature selection.
